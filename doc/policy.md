## Do Not Track

Currently, most browsers — including Firefox, Chromium, Vivaldi, Edge and
Safari etc. — offer a **Do Not Track** (`DNT`) option that relies on a
technology known as a `DNT header`, which sends a signal to server
applications visited by the user about the user's browser `DNT` setting.

We respect the user's choice and their privacy.

Our tracking script cares only about texts, elements and scroll speed.
It does not contain sensitive data. Nevertheless, it does not send any
data to server, if user wants.
